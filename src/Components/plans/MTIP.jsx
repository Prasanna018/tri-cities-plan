                    <p className='py-2'>The FFY 23 TCAMPO Authorizations List identifies the project number, date of authorization, type of work, amount of work, and whether it is state or federal funds. Note that in the case of projects that are included based on County / Divisionwide / Statewide, they may be partially or completely outside the MPO area. There were some instances where all the funds that were previously authorized were not needed. In those cases, a portion of the funding authorization was removed, and this negative value is denoted by parentheses.</p>
                    <p className='py-2'>The MPO is also required to post an FFY 23 TCAMPO Transit Authorizations List, of all transit projects, not just those using STI funds. The list includes information on transit grant agreements for projects within the MPO counties that were executed during the 2023 Federal fiscal year. This list includes every project within the counties that are wholly or partially within the MPO area. Therefore, some of the projects on the list may not fall within the MPO’s jurisdiction.</p>
